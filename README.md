Repository that shall hold each microservice that shall serve as the backend for my AirBnB clone personal project.

Each microservice has its own responsibility. At this time each are Fat Jars deployed on their own embedded-Tomcat instance, though listening on separate ports.

Later, I plan to deploy one WAR, on an standalone Tomcat server, Docker, or and AWS ECS or EC2. I'm still deliberating on this...
